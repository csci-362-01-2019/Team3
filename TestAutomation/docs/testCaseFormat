The test cases should be written to test the criteria set by Openaq for their air quality data sources.
From Openaq:
Data Source Criteria

This section lists the key criteria for air quality data aggregated onto the platform.

(1) Data must be of one of these pollutant types: PM10, PM2.5, sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and black carbon (BC).

(2) Data must be from an official-level outdoor air quality source, as defined as data produced by a government entity or international organization. We do not, at this stage, include data from low-cost, temporary, and/or indoor sensors. 

(3) Data must be ‘raw’ and reported in physical concentrations on their originating site. Data cannot be shared in an 'Air Quality Index' or equivalent (e.g. AQI, PSI, API) format.

(4) Data must be at the ‘station-level,’ associable with geographic coordinates, not aggregated into a higher (e.g. city) level.

(5) Data must be from measurements averaged between 10 minutes and 24 hours.


Test cases are made with two parts:
(1) A plain test test case file in the following format
	Test number
	Test case name
	Oracle
(2) A .json data file built from the template Team3/TestAutomation/testCaseFiles/template.json

The test cases should seek to test the criteria listed above. For the first five test cases, the "parameter" field of a data source .json field are tested. Per the criteria, it should not be a valid data source unless the parameter is of the following types: PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, NO2, O3, or BC.
